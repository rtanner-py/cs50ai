## Quiz

Question 1
*Consider a standard 52-card deck of cards with 13 card values (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 2-10) in each of the four suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades). If a card is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is a spade or a two?*

P(spade) = 13 / 52
P(2) = 4/52

P(spade or 2) = P(spade) + P(2) - P(spade and 2)

13/52 + 4/52 - (13/52 * 4/52) = 0.30769230769230769230769230769231

*Answer: 0.308*

Question 2: 
*Imagine flipping two fair coins, where each coin has a Heads side and a Tails side, with Heads coming up 50% of the time and Tails coming up 50% of the time. What is probability that after flipping those two coins, one of them lands heads and the other lands tails?*

H,T
T,H
H,H
T,T

There is no reference to order within the question, so it is either H,T or T,H (2 combinations out of a possible 4)

*Answer: 50% or $\frac{1}{2}$*

Question 3: 
Refers to the Bayesian Network in the lecture.

*Answer: Assuming we know the train is on time, whether or not there is track maintenance does not affect the probability that the appointment is attended.*

Question 4:
*Two factories — Factory A and Factory B — design batteries to be used in mobile phones. Factory A produces 60% of all batteries, and Factory B produces the other 40%. 2% of Factory A’s batteries have defects, and 4% of Factory B’s batteries have defects. What is the probability that a battery is both made by Factory A and defective?*

P(A) = 0.6
P(B) = 0.4

2% of A defective
4% of B defective

P(A and Defective) = 0.6 * 0.02 = 0.012

*Answer: 0.012*
